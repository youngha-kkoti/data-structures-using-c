        - List
    - Non-Linear Structures
        - Tree
            - General Tree
            - Binary Tree
                - Binary Search Tree
                - AVL Tree
        - Priority Queue
        - Graph
            - Directed Graph
            - Undirected Graph
            - Weighted Graph
        - Map
### Conditions of an algorithm
- **Input**: There must be 0 or more inputs.
- **Output**: There must be 1 or more outputs.
- **Explicitness**: The meaning of each instruction must be clear and unambiguous.
- **Finiteness**: It must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Validity**: Each instruction must be an executable operation.
### ADT
ADT, or Abstract Data Type, is a theoretical concept in computer science and data structures that defines a data type purely by its behavior (operations) rather than by its implementation. It focuses on what operations can be performed on the data, without specifying how they are implemented.
An ADT consists of:
1. **Data**: The values or elements the ADT can hold.
2. **Operations**: The operations that can be performed on the data (e.g., insertion, deletion, retrieval).
